  testimonials:
    - quote: "Before, I sometimes wondered if the number of guests really matched the booking. Now, the Signal gives me a subtle data point – a quiet notification if it detects more activity than the reservation suggests. This empowers me to verify things discreetly if needed. That level of certainty is a huge relief."
      author: "Mark T., Airbnb Host (Beta User)"
    - quote: "My main turnover headache was uncertainty about guests leaving. Signal's alert when the property is truly empty is a game-changer. It ensures precise cleaning scheduling and efficient operations, saving time while respecting guest privacy."
